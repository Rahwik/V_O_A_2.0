Voice Operated Assistant 2.0
============================

This presentation explains the functionality of a Python script designed to act as a voice-operated assistant. Below are the key components and their functions:

Script Overview
---------------

1.  **Imports:** The script imports necessary libraries such as `os`, `pygame`, `speech_recognition`, and custom module `bot_scrapper`.
2.  **Function: speak(text):** This function utilizes the Edge TTS service to convert text into speech. It uses the specified voice (in this case, "en-US-EricNeural") and saves the output as an MP3 file. The MP3 file is then played using Pygame's mixer module.
3.  **Function: take\_command():** This function captures audio from the microphone using the SpeechRecognition library. It waits for a pause of 1 second before recognizing the speech input. The recognized speech is then returned as a string.
4.  **Main Loop:** The script enters an infinite loop, continuously listening for voice commands. Upon receiving a command, it converts it to lowercase, sends the query to a function called `sendQuery()`, checks if a loading indicator is visible, retrieves the response, and speaks the response using the `speak()` function.

Usage
-----

The script allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands. It can perform various tasks based on the commands provided by the user.

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   Pygame
*   SpeechRecognition
*   Custom module `bot_scrapper` (Assumed to contain functions related to web scraping or bot interactions)

Functionality
-------------

The Voice Operated Assistant 2.0 enables hands-free interaction with the computer. Users can issue commands verbally, and the assistant will execute them accordingly. The assistant's functionality can be extended by adding additional commands and integrating with other services or APIs.
